                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight 
                    language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to 
                    the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.       
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of 
                    language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be 
                    extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
                </p>

                <div class="list-items">
                    <li>
                        Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and
                        its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to 
                        place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, 
                        and page navigation.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript 
                        on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, 
                        provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file 
                        manipulations on a server.
                    </li>
                </div>
            </section> 
            
            <section id="what-should-you-know">
                <h1>What you should already know</h1>
